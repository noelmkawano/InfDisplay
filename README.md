##Overview

My name is Noel Kawano and I am the creator of the Infinity Display! This piece of hardware incorporates two subjects, infinity mirrors and light emitting diode (LED) matrices.

An infinity mirror is an optical illusion created by two parallel mirrors reflecting light between each other. This can be typically found in restrooms. Infinity mirrors is a common project for DIY hobbyists and was my first project as a college student.

A LED matrix is an array of lights similar to a TV, but with a low pixel density. Like a TV, we are able to map images and animations to the display. This is also very popular with hobbyist, but never pursued on the large scale because of the cost.

The Infinity Display is a combination of these two subjects. The parallel mirrors lay on the frame with a LED display as a back light. The light from the LEDs become trapped between the mirrors and create the tunneling optical illusion of an infinity mirror.

The goal of this repository is to develope a controller that will drive the LEDs based on inputs submitted by multiple users. If you want to know more about this web app refer to the following guides.

## User Guide

The [User Guide](https://github.com/noelmkawano/InfDisplay/wiki/User-Guide) will help you get started with the controller. On site directions can be found [here](http://www.infdisplay.com/directions).

## Developer Guide
